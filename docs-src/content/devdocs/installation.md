To install *Qurl* the most easy way is to use the golang tooling and execute
the following:

```bash
$ go get install github.com/repejota/qurl
```

If you have already installed a previous version of *Qurl*, you can upgrade it
executing this:

```bash
$ go get -u install github.com/repejota/qurl
```
